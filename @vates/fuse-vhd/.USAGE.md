Mount a vhd generated by xen-orchestra to filesystem

### Library

```js
import { mount } from 'fuse-vhd'

// return a disposable, see promise-toolbox/Disposable
// unmount automatically when disposable is disposed
// in case of differencing VHD, it mounts the full chain
await mount(handler, diskId, mountPoint)
```

### cli

From the install folder:

```
cli.mjs <remoteUrl> <vhdPathInRemote> <mountPoint>
```

After installing the package

```
xo-fuse-vhd <remoteUrl> <vhdPathInRemote> <mountPoint>
```

The `remoteUrl` can be found using the following command from the XOA CLI, and then picking the right `url` property:

`xo-server-db ls remote`

## Restore a file from a VHD using `fuse-vhd` CLI

1. Mount a VHD to the Filesystem (see **Usage**).
2. Verify the VHD is Correctly Mounted:

`mount | grep fuse`

3. Get the `START` and `SIZE` of the disk whose file you want to restore. Multiply `START` by 512 (block size) to get the offset value. (`mountedVhdPath` is the `mountPoint` value from earlier, followed by `/vhd0`, for example). Depending on the partition type, you may need to do some additional setup to discover the partitions.

`partx --bytes --output=NR,START,SIZE,NAME,UUID,TYPE --pairs <mountedVhdPath>`

4.  Mount the disk. Depending on the partition type, you may need to add some additionnal options. The `norecovery` option is used for ext3/ext4/xfs file systems, otherwise remove this option.

`mount --options=loop,ro,norecovery,sizelimit=<SIZE>,offset=<START*512>  --source=<mountedVhdPath> --target=<diskMountPoint>`

5. Copy Your Files from the mounted partition and then unmount the partition.
