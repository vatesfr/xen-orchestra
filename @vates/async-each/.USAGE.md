### `asyncEach(iterable, iteratee, [opts])`

Executes `iteratee` in order for each value yielded by `iterable`.

Returns a promise wich rejects as soon as a call to `iteratee` throws or a promise returned by it rejects, and which resolves when all promises returned by `iteratee` have resolved.

`iterable` must be an iterable or async iterable.

`iteratee` is called with the same `this` value as `asyncEach`, and with the following arguments:

- `value`: the value yielded by `iterable`
- `index`: the 0-based index for this value
- `iterable`: the iterable itself

`opts` is an object that can contains the following options:

- `concurrency`: a number which indicates the maximum number of parallel call to `iteratee`, defaults to `10`. The value `0` means no concurrency limit.
- `signal`: an abort signal to stop the iteration
- `stopOnError`: whether to stop iteration of first error, or wait for all calls to finish and throw an `AggregateError`, defaults to `true`

```js
import { asyncEach } from '@vates/async-each'

const contents = []
await asyncEach(
  ['foo.txt', 'bar.txt', 'baz.txt'],
  async function (filename, i) {
    contents[i] = await readFile(filename)
  },
  {
    // reads two files at a time
    concurrency: 2,
  }
)
```
