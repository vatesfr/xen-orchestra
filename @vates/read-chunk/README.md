> Read a chunk of a Node stream

## Install

Installation of the [npm package](https://npmjs.org/package/@vates/read-chunk):

```sh
npm install --save @vates/read-chunk
```

## Usage

### `readChunk(stream, [size])`

- returns the next available chunk of data
- like `stream.read()`, a number of bytes can be specified
- returns with less data than expected if stream has ended
- returns `null` if the stream has ended and no data has been read

```js
import { readChunk } from '@vates/read-chunk'
;(async () => {
  let chunk
  while ((chunk = await readChunk(stream, 1024)) !== null) {
    // do something with chunk
  }
})()
```

### `readChunkStrict(stream, [size])`

Similar behavior to `readChunk` but throws if the stream ended before the requested data could be read.

```js
import { readChunkStrict } from '@vates/read-chunk'

const chunk = await readChunkStrict(stream, 1024)
```

### `skip(stream, size)`

Skips a given number of bytes from a stream.

Returns the number of bytes actually skipped, which may be less than the requested size if the stream has ended.

```js
import { skip } from '@vates/read-chunk'

const bytesSkipped = await skip(stream, 2 * 1024 * 1024 * 1024)
```

### `skipStrict(stream, size)`

Skips a given number of bytes from a stream and throws if the stream ended before enough stream has been skipped.

```js
import { skipStrict } from '@vates/read-chunk'

await skipStrict(stream, 2 * 1024 * 1024 * 1024)
```
