A toolbox to ease the use of generator

### Timeout

wrap a source async generator to have it throw an error when timeout is reached
timeout is a positive number in milliseconds

```js
import { Timeout } from '@vates/generator-toolbox'

const wrappedGenerator = new Timeout(sourceGenerator, timeout)
```

### Throttle

wrap a source async generator to have it respect a max speed ( in bytes per seconds).
speed is either a strictly positive number or a function returning a strictly positive number. A speed change will be used for the next emitted packet.

The source generator must yield object with a length property.

Optimized for small yields regarding to the speed, since it won't split incoming packet.

If the generator reached the max speed it will be paused, limiting memory consumption.

```js
import { Throttle } from '@vates/generator-toolbox'

const wrappedGenerator = new Throttle(sourceGenerator, speed)
```

### Synchronized

Fork a generator. The rules are:

- if the source returns, all the forks return
- if the forks error, all the forks error with the same error
- if a fork returns, it is stopped, but the generator continue with the other
- if a fork errors, it is stopped, but the generator continue with the other
- if all the forks return, the source is stopped
- if all the forks error, the source is errored with the last error
- the source start producing a packet when the fastest forked ask for it
- the source forks get the packet only when all the forks asked for it, no buffer stores in memory

```ts
import { Synchronized } from '@vates/generator-toolbox'

async function consume(generator: AsyncGenerator) {
  for await (const val of generator) {
    console.log({ val })
  }
}
const forker = new Synchronized(generator)
const first = forker.fork('first')
const second = forker.fork('second')
await Promise.all([consume(first), consume(second)])
```

Note: you can stop early a generator by calling `generator.return()`, and you can stop in in error by calling `generator.throw(error)`
