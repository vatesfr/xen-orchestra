### Security

> Security fixes and new features should go in this section

### Enhancements

> Users must be able to say: "Nice enhancement, I'm eager to test it"

- [Side panels] Side panels can be resized like the treeview, whose default width now adapts to the screen size (PR [#10725](https://github.com/vatesfr/xen-orchestra/pull/10725))
- [Side panels] Values stay next to their label when they fit and move below it otherwise, fields with several values (IP addresses, report recipients…) get a copy button per value and a "Copy all" action, and rows, links and statuses are more evenly spaced and sized (PR [#10733](https://github.com/vatesfr/xen-orchestra/pull/10733))
- [Treeview] A more compact tree, so that names get more room: lower rows running edge to edge and a smaller indent per level; hovering a quick actions button no longer highlights its whole row (PR [#10727](https://github.com/vatesfr/xen-orchestra/pull/10727))

### Bug fixes

> Users must be able to say: "I had this issue, happy to know it's fixed"

- [XO6/Pools] Pool side panel now shows the same pool name, UUID and icon as the pools table, and keeps the pool card when the pool is disconnected or unreachable (PR [#10714](https://github.com/vatesfr/xen-orchestra/pull/10714))

### Packages to release

> When modifying a package, add it here with its release type.
>
> The format is the following: `- $packageName $releaseType`
>
> Where `$releaseType` is
>
> - patch: if the change is a bug fix or a simple code improvement
> - minor: if the change is a new feature
> - major: if the change breaks compatibility
>
> Keep this list alphabetically ordered to avoid merge conflicts
