- [VM/Network] Show IP addresses in front of their VIFs [#4882](https://github.com/vatesfr/xen-orchestra/issues/4882) (PR [#5003](https://github.com/vatesfr/xen-orchestra/pull/5003))

### Bug fixes

> Users must be able to say: “I had this issue, happy to know it's fixed”

### Released packages

> Packages will be released in the order they are here, therefore, they should
> be listed by inverse order of dependency.
>
> Rule of thumb: add packages on top.
>
> The format is the following: - `$packageName` `$version`
>
> Where `$version` is
>
> - patch: if the change is a bug fix or a simple code improvement
> - minor: if the change is a new feature
> - major: if the change breaks compatibility
>
> In case of conflict, the highest (lowest in previous list) `$version` wins.
