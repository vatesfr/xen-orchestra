### Enhancements

> Users must be able to say: “Nice enhancement, I'm eager to test it”

### Bug fixes

> Users must be able to say: “I had this issue, happy to know it's fixed”

- [VM/network] Fix an issue where multiple IPs would be displayed in the same tag when using old Xen tools. This also fixes Netbox's IP synchronization for the affected VMs. (PR [#5860](https://github.com/vatesfr/xen-orchestra/pull/5860))

### Packages to release

> Packages will be released in the order they are here, therefore, they should
> be listed by inverse order of dependency.
>
> Rule of thumb: add packages on top.
>
> The format is the following: - `$packageName` `$version`
>
> Where `$version` is
>
> - patch: if the change is a bug fix or a simple code improvement
> - minor: if the change is a new feature
> - major: if the change breaks compatibility
>
> In case of conflict, the highest (lowest in previous list) `$version` wins.

- xo-server patch
