- [XO6/Pools] Pool side panel now shows the same pool name, UUID and icon as the pools table, and keeps the pool card when the pool is disconnected or unreachable (PR [#10714](https://github.com/vatesfr/xen-orchestra/pull/10714))
- [Tasks] Aborting a task now also stops the steps it had not started yet: a step started after the abort used to ignore it and run to the end
