### Enhancements

> Users must be able to say: “Nice enhancement, I'm eager to test it”

- [Backup] Merge multiple VHDs at once which will speed up the merging ĥase after reducing the retention of a backup job(PR [#6184](https://github.com/vatesfr/xen-orchestra/pull/6184))
- [Backup] Implement file cache for listing the backups of a VM (PR [#6220](https://github.com/vatesfr/xen-orchestra/pull/6220))

### Bug fixes

> Users must be able to say: “I had this issue, happy to know it's fixed”

### Packages to release

> Packages will be released in the order they are here, therefore, they should
> be listed by inverse order of dependency.
>
> Rule of thumb: add packages on top.
>
> The format is the following: - `$packageName` `$version`
>
> Where `$version` is
>
> - patch: if the change is a bug fix or a simple code improvement
> - minor: if the change is a new feature
> - major: if the change breaks compatibility
>
> In case of conflict, the highest (lowest in previous list) `$version` wins.
>
> The `gen-deps-list` script can be used to generate this list of dependencies
> Run `scripts/gen-deps-list.js --help` for usage
