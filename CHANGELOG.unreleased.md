### Enhancements

> Users must be able to say: "Nice enhancement, I'm eager to test it"

- [Pool/Advanced] Live vCPU scaling: a pool can give the VMs XO creates a vCPU maximum (16 by default), so vCPUs can be added later while they run, without a shutdown. Opt-in, capped by the smallest host of the pool, not applied to Windows VMs
- [VM] Lowering the vCPUs of a running Windows VM is now refused: Windows kept running the removed vCPUs while XAPI reported the lower count

### Bug fixes

> Users must be able to say: "I had this issue, happy to know it's fixed"

- [XO6/Pools] Pool side panel now shows the same pool name, UUID and icon as the pools table, and keeps the pool card when the pool is disconnected or unreachable (PR [#10714](https://github.com/vatesfr/xen-orchestra/pull/10714))
