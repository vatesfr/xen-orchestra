- [Backup/Remotes] Listing backup repositories is no longer slowed down by an unreachable one: a broken repository is now served from cache and retried in the background instead of timing out on every refresh (PR [#10025](https://github.com/vatesfr/xen-orchestra/pull/10025))

### Packages to release

> When modifying a package, add it here with its release type.
>
> The format is the following: `- $packageName $releaseType`
>
> Where `$releaseType` is
>
> - patch: if the change is a bug fix or a simple code improvement
> - minor: if the change is a new feature
> - major: if the change breaks compatibility
>
> Keep this list alphabetically ordered to avoid merge conflicts
