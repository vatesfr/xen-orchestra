:::warning
If you installed your XO from a 3rd party script (any method outside [our official documentation](installation.md#from-the-sources)), please report your issue **first** on the script repository. We can't waste time on debugging 3rd party installers.
:::

If you have issues on XO installed from the sources (via GitHub), please **always** do first:

1. update your XO to latest `master` commit (see how-to in the [dedicated section](installation.md#updating)) and retest again
2. if the issue persist, double check you have all the requirements checked from the [installation section](installation.md#from-the-sources) and test again
3. then, if you still experience problems, remove and rebuild from scratch

Only after that, you can go on the [dedicated forum](https://xcp-ng.org/forum/category/12/xen-orchestra) to ask about your problem.

:::tip
If you want a consistent and tested solution for using Xen Orchestra, we strongly advise to use our preconfigured and validated [Xen Orchestra virtual Appliance](installation.md#xoa).
