## Documentation / Code

Using the GitHub fork/pull-request feature, you may send us fixes or enhancements.

Please, do explain:

- what you are fixing (issue number if available);
- how you did it.

### Pull requests

The best way to propose a change to the documentation or code is
to create a [GitHub pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/).

1. Fork the [Xen Orchestra repository](https://github.com/vatesfr/xen-orchestra) using the Fork button
2. Follow [the documentation](installation.md#from-the-sources) to install and run Xen Orchestra from the sources
3. Create a branch for your work
4. Edit the source files
5. Add a summary of your changes to `CHANGELOG.unreleased.md`, if your changes do not relate to an existing changelog item and update the list of packages that must be released to take your changes into account
6. [Create a pull request](https://github.com/vatesfr/xen-orchestra/compare) for this branch against the `master` branch
7. Push into the branch until the pull request is ready to merge
8. Avoid unnecessary merges: keep you branch up to date by regularly rebasing `git rebase origin/master`
9. When ready to merge, clean up the history (reorder commits, squash some of them together, rephrase messages): `git rebase -i origin/master`

### Issue triage

#### Labels

**Type**

- bug
- cleanup: should be taken care of to avoid technical debt

:::

**Difficulty**

:::tip
This helps new people to contribute.
:::

1. easy
2. medium

**Component**

- backup
- GUI
- upstream: not a XO issue → link to the upstream issue and monitor progress

**Severity**

1. low: will be fixed when possible
2. medium
3. high: should be fixed for the next release
4. critical: should be fixed ASAP and a patch release is done once fixed

:::warning
A new version MUST NOT be released with a `high` or `critical` issue.
