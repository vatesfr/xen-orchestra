# REST API

:::warning ‚ö†Ô∏è Beta feature
This is a beta feature that may see some changes in the future. The fully up-to-date README [is available here](https://github.com/vatesfr/xen-orchestra/blob/master/packages/xo-server/docs/rest-api.md). This page is only here to explain how it works, it's not intended to be used as an accurate guide.
:::

We originally developed [our existing API](architecture.html#api) to be used between the Web UI `xo-web` and the server backend, `xo-server`. That's why it's a JSON-RPC API connected via websockets, allowing us to update objects live in the browser. This is perfect for our usage, but a bit complicated for others.

Also, this API wasn't meant to be public, but over the years some users have expressed a desire to be able to use it for their own purposes. This led us to add more tooling around it, like `xo-cli` and to answer specific requests.

For these reasons we decided to build a new API. Not an evolution of the current one, but 100% new. It is meant to be public and [REST-like](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer). So a simple curl command can request it. We will also provide documentation as the intended goal is for it to be used by the public.

## Authentication

A valid authentication token should be attached as a cookie to all HTTP
requests:

```http
GET /rest/v0 HTTP/1.1
Cookie: authenticationToken=TN2YBOMYtXB_hHtf4wTzm9p5tTuqq2i15yeuhcz2xXM
```

The server will respond to an invalid token with a `401 Unauthorized` status.

**[Not implemented at this time]** The server can request that the client updates its token with a `Set-Cookie` header:

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Set-Cookie: authenticationToken=KQxQdm2vMiv7jBIK0hgkmgxKzemd8wSJ7ugFGKFkTbs
```

Usage with cURL:

```bash
curl -b \
    authenticationToken=KQxQdm2vMiv7jBIK0hgkmgxKzemd8wSJ7ugFGKFkTbs \
    https://xo.company.lan/rest/v0/
```

You can use `xo-cli` to create an authentication token:

```bash
$ xo-cli create-token xoa.company.lan admin@admin.net
Password: ********
Successfully logged with admin@admin.net
Authentication token created

```

:::tip
Only admin users can currently use the API.

## Collections request

Collections of objects are available at `/<name>` (e.g. `/vms`)

The following query parameters are supported:

- `limit`: max number of objects returned
- `fields`: if specified, instead of plain URLs, the results will be objects containing the requested fields
- `filter`: a string that will be used to select only matching objects, see [the syntax documentation](manage_infrastructure.md#live-filter-search)
- `ndjson`: if specified, the result will be in [NDJSON format](http://ndjson.org/)

Simple request:

```http
GET /rest/v0/vms HTTP/1.1
Cookie: authenticationToken=TN2YBOMYtXB_hHtf4wTzm9p5tTuqq2i15yeuhcz2xXM

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

[
  "/rest/v0/vms/770aa52a-fd42-8faf-f167-8c5c4a237cac",
  "/rest/v0/vms/5019156b-f40d-bc57-835b-4a259b177be1"
]
```

Here is an example with `curl`:

```console
$ curl \
  -b authenticationToken=0OQIKwb1WjeHtch25Ls \
  http://xoa.example.com/rest/v0/vms?fields=name_label,power_state
[
  {
    "name_label": "FreeNAS",
    "power_state": "Running",
    "href": "/rest/v0/vms/0fc14abc-ae7a-4209-79c4-d20ca1f0e567"
  },
  {
    "name_label": "Ubuntu 20.04 test",
    "power_state": "Halted",
    "href": "/rest/v0/vms/d505eb99-164e-5516-27e1-43837a01be45"
  },
  {
    "name_label": "Rocky Linux 8",
    "power_state": "Halted",
    "href": "/rest/v0/vms/38f423b7-1498-ee8c-ca8d-d3bb8fcffcf2"
  },
  {
    "name_label": "XOA üé∑",
    "power_state": "Running",
    "href": "/rest/v0/vms/857e34e5-c61a-f3f1-65e6-a7a9306b347b"
  }
]
```

As NDJSON:

```http
GET /rest/v0/vms?fields=name_label,power_state&ndjson HTTP/1.1
Cookie: authenticationToken=TN2YBOMYtXB_hHtf4wTzm9p5tTuqq2i15yeuhcz2xXM

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/x-ndjson

{"name_label":"Debian 10 Cloudinit","power_state":"Running","url":"/rest/v0/vms/770aa52a-fd42-8faf-f167-8c5c4a237cac"}
{"name_label":"Debian 10 Cloudinit self-service","power_state":"Halted","url":"/rest/v0/vms/5019156b-f40d-bc57-835b-4a259b177be1"}
```

## Task monitoring

### Specific task

When fetching a task record, the special `wait` query string can be used. If its value is `result` it will wait for the task to be resolved (either success or failure) before returning, otherwise it will wait for the next change of state.

```sh
curl \
  -b authenticationToken=KQxQdm2vMiv7jBIK0hgkmgxKzemd8wSJ7ugFGKFkTbs \
  'https://xo.example.org/rest/v0/tasks/0lr4zljbe?wait=result'
```

### All tasks

A watch mode is available when fetching the collection as NDJSON by using both `ndjson` and `watch` query strings. Instead of sending the objects directly, each entry will be an array `[event, object]`. `event` can be either `remove` to mean that an object has been removed from the collection or `update` to mean that an object has been added to the collection or updated.

In case of the `remove` event, only the `id` properties of the deleted object is available.

The `fields` and `filter` parameters are supported.

Example:

```http
GET /rest/v0/vms?fields=start,status&ndjson&watch HTTP/1.1
Cookie: authenticationToken=TN2YBOMYtXB_hHtf4wTzm9p5tTuqq2i15yeuhcz2xXM

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/x-ndjson

["remove",{"href":"/rest/v0/tasks/0lv13orww"}]
["update",{"start":1713194362080,"status":"pending","href":"/rest/v0/tasks/0lv13otzz"}]
```

> This request does not send existing tasks, only events. If you want to get the whole collection and keep it up-to-date, the correct way to do that is:
>
> 1. start a watch request
> 2. fetch the whole collection via a normal request
> 3. process events sent by the watch request to update the local cache

## Properties update

> This feature is restricted to `name_label`, `name_description` and `tags` at the moment.

```sh
curl \
  -X PATCH \
  -b authenticationToken=KQxQdm2vMiv7jBIK0hgkmgxKzemd8wSJ7ugFGKFkTbs \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'Accept: application/json' \
  -d '{ "name_label": "The new name", "name_description": "The new description" }' \
  'https://xo.example.org/rest/v0/vms/770aa52a-fd42-8faf-f167-8c5c4a237cac'
```

### Collections

For collection properties, like `tags`, it can be more practical to touch a single item without impacting the others.

An item can be created with `PUT <collection>/<item id>` and can be destroyed with `DELETE <collection>/<item id>`.

Adding a tag:

```sh
curl \
-X PUT \
-b authenticationToken=KQxQdm2vMiv7jBIK0hgkmgxKzemd8wSJ7ugFGKFkTbs \
'https://xo.example.org/rest/v0/vms/770aa52a-fd42-8faf-f167-8c5c4a237cac/tags/My%20tag'
```

Removing a tag:

```sh
curl \
  -X DELETE \
  -b authenticationToken=KQxQdm2vMiv7jBIK0hgkmgxKzemd8wSJ7ugFGKFkTbs \
  'https://xo.example.org/rest/v0/vms/770aa52a-fd42-8faf-f167-8c5c4a237cac/tags/My%20tag'
```

## VM and VDI destruction

For a VM:

```sh
curl \
  -X DELETE \
  -b authenticationToken=KQxQdm2vMiv7jBIK0hgkmgxKzemd8wSJ7ugFGKFkTbs \
  'https://xo.example.org/rest/v0/vms/770aa52a-fd42-8faf-f167-8c5c4a237cac'
```

For a VDI:

```sh
curl \
  -X DELETE \
  -b authenticationToken=KQxQdm2vMiv7jBIK0hgkmgxKzemd8wSJ7ugFGKFkTbs \
  'https://xo.example.org/rest/v0/vdis/1a269782-ea93-4c4c-897a-475365f7b674'
```

## VM and VDI export

VDI export and VM export are supported by the API. Below is a simple example to export a VM with `zstd` compression into a `myVM.xva` file:

```sh
curl \
  -b authenticationToken=KQxQdm2vMiv7jFEAZXOAGKFkTbs \
  'https://xoa.example.org/rest/v0/vms/770aa52a-fd42-8faf-f167-8c5c4a237a12.xva?compress=zstd' \
  > myVM.xva
```

A VDI can be exported in VHD format at `/rest/v0/vdis/<uuid>.vhd` or the raw content at `/rest/v0/vdis/<uuid>.raw`.

```sh
curl \
  -b authenticationToken=KQxQdm2vMiv7FkTbs \
  'https://xoa.example.org/rest/v0/vdis/1a269782-ea93-4c4c-897a-475365f7b674.vhd' \
  > myDisk.vhd
```

The following optional query parameters are supported for VDI export:

- `preferNbd`: will use NBD for export if available
- `nbdConcurrency=<integer>`: set the number of concurrent stream per disk if NBD is enabled, default 1

## VM Import

> OVA import is not supported.

A VM can be imported by posting an XVA to `/rest/v0/pools/:id/vms`.

```sh
curl \
  -X POST \
  -b authenticationToken=KQxQdm2vMiv7jBIK0hgkmgxKzemd8wSJ7ugFGKFkTbs \
  -T myDisk.raw \
  'https://xo.example.org/rest/v0/pools/355ee47d-ff4c-4924-3db2-fd86ae629676/vms?sr=357bd56c-71f9-4b2a-83b8-3451dec04b8f' \
  | cat
```

The `sr` query parameter can be used to specify on which SR the VM should be imported, if not specified, the default SR will be used.

> Note: the final `| cat` ensures cURL's standard output is not a TTY, which is necessary for upload stats to be displayed.

## VDI Import

### Existing VDI

A VHD or a raw export can be imported in an existing VDI respectively at `/rest/v0/vdis/<uuid>.vhd` and `/rest/v0/vdis/<uuid>.raw`.

> Note: the size of the VDI must match exactly the size of VDI that was previously exported.

```sh
curl \
  -X PUT \
  -b authenticationToken=KQxQdm2vMiv7jBIK0hgkmgxKzemd8wSJ7ugFGKFkTbs \
  -T myDisk.vhd \
  'https://xo.example.org/rest/v0/vdis/1a269782-ea93-4c4c-897a-475365f7b674.vhd' \
  | cat
```

> Note: the final `| cat` ensures cURL's standard output is not a TTY, which is necessary for upload stats to be displayed.

### New VDI

An export can also be imported on an SR to create a new VDI at `/rest/v0/srs/<sr uuid>/vdis`.

```sh
curl \
  -X POST \
  -b authenticationToken=KQxQdm2vMiv7jBIK0hgkmgxKzemd8wSJ7ugFGKFkTbs \
  -T myDisk.raw \
  'https://xo.example.org/rest/v0/srs/357bd56c-71f9-4b2a-83b8-3451dec04b8f/vdis?raw&name_label=my_imported_VDI' \
  | cat
```

> Note: the final `| cat` ensures cURL's standard output is not a TTY, which is necessary for upload stats to be displayed.

This request returns the UUID of the created VDI.

The following query parameters are supported to customize the created VDI:

- `name_label`
- `name_description`
- `raw`: this parameter must be used if importing a raw export instead of a VHD

## Actions

### Available actions

To see the actions available on objects of a specific collection, get the collection at `/rest/v0/<type>/_/actions`.

For example, to list all actions on a VM:

```console
$ curl \
  -b authenticationToken=KQxQdm2vMiv7jBIK0hgkmgxKzemd8wSJ7ugFGKFkTbs \
  'https://xo.company.lan/rest/v0/vms/_/actions'
[
"/rest/v0/vms/_/actions/clean_reboot",
"/rest/v0/vms/_/actions/clean_shutdown",
"/rest/v0/vms/_/actions/hard_reboot",
"/rest/v0/vms/_/actions/hard_shutdown",
"/rest/v0/vms/_/actions/snapshot",
"/rest/v0/vms/_/actions/start"
]
```

To see more information about a specific action, you can checkout its endpoint:

```console
$ curl \
  -b authenticationToken=KQxQdm2vMiv7jBIK0hgkmgxKzemd8wSJ7ugFGKFkTbs \
  'https://xo.company.lan/rest/v0/vms/_/actions/snapshot'
{
  "params": {
    "name_label": {
      "type": "string",
      "optional": true
    }
  }
}
```

The field `params` contains the [JSON schema](https://json-schema.org/) for the parameters.

### Start an action

Post at the action endpoint which is `/rest/v0/<type>/<uuid>/actions/<action>`.

For instance, to reboot a VM:

```sh
curl \
  -X POST \
  -b authenticationToken=KQxQdm2vMiv7jBIK0hgkmgxKzemd8wSJ7ugFGKFkTbs \
  'https://xo.example.org/rest/v0/vms/770aa52a-fd42-8faf-f167-8c5c4a237cac/actions/clean_reboot'
```

Some actions accept parameters, they should be provided in a JSON-encoded object as the request body:

```sh
curl \
  -X POST \
  -b authenticationToken=KQxQdm2vMiv7jBIK0hgkmgxKzemd8wSJ7ugFGKFkTbs \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'Accept: application/json' \
  -d '{ "name_label": "My snapshot" }' \
  'https://xo.example.org/rest/v0/vms/770aa52a-fd42-8faf-f167-8c5c4a237cac/actions/snapshot'
```

By default, actions are asynchronous and return the reference of the task associated with the request (see [_Task monitoring_](#task-monitoring)).

The `?sync` flag can be used to run the action synchronously without requiring task monitoring. The result of the action will be returned encoded as JSON:

```console
$ curl \
  -X POST \
  -b authenticationToken=KQxQdm2vMiv7jBIK0hgkmgxKzemd8wSJ7ugFGKFkTbs \
  'https://xo.example.org/rest/v0/vms/770aa52a-fd42-8faf-f167-8c5c4a237cac/actions/clean_reboot'
"2b0266aa-c753-6fbc-e4dd-c79be7782052"
```

## The future

We are adding features and improving the REST API step by step. If you have interesting use cases or feedback, please ask directly at <https://xcp-ng.org/forum/category/12/xen-orchestra>
