# Configuration

Once Xen Orchestra is installed, you can configure some parameters in the configuration file. Let's see how to do that.

:::tip
The configuration file is located at `/etc/xo-server/config.toml`.
:::

If you need to do any configuration on the system itself (firewall, SSHâ€¦), check the [XOA dedicated section](xoa.md).

## User to run XO-server as

By default, XO-server runs as 'root'. You can change that by uncommenting these lines and choose whatever user/group you want:

```toml
user = 'nobody'
group = 'nogroup'
```

**Warning!** A non-privileged user requires the use of `sudo` to mount NFS shares. See [installation from the sources](installation.md#from-the-sources).

## HTTP listen address and port

By default, XO-server listens on all addresses (0.0.0.0) and runs on port 80. If you need to, you can change this in the `# Basic HTTP` section:

```toml
hostname = '0.0.0.0'
port = 80
```

## HTTPS and certificates

XO-server can also run in HTTPS (you can run HTTP and HTTPS at the same time) - just modify what's needed in the `# Basic HTTPS` section, this time with the certificates/keys you need and their path:

```toml
hostname = '0.0.0.0'
port = 443
certificate = './certificate.pem'
key = './key.pem'
```

:::tip
If a chain of certificates authorities is needed, you may bundle them directly in the certificate. Note: the order of certificates does matter, your certificate should come first followed by the certificate of the above certificate authority up to the root.
:::

### HTTPS redirection

If you want to redirect everything to HTTPS, you can modify the configuration like this:

```toml
# If set to true, all HTTP traffic will be redirected to the first HTTPs configuration.

redirectToHttps = true
```

This should be written just before the `mount` option, inside the `http:` block.

## Link to xo-web

You shouldn't have to change this. It's the path where `xo-web` files are served by `xo-server`.

```toml
[http.mounts]
'/' = '../xo-web/dist/'
```

## Custom certificate authority

If you use certificates signed by an in-house CA for your XCP-ng or XenServer hosts, and want to have Xen Orchestra connect to them without rejection, you can use the [`NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS`](https://nodejs.org/api/cli.html#cli_node_extra_ca_certs_file) environment variable.

To enable this option in your XOA, create `/etc/systemd/system/xo-server.service.d/ca.conf` with the following content:

```ini
[Service]
Environment=NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS=/usr/local/share/ca-certificates/my-cert.crt
```

Don't forget to reload `systemd` conf and restart `xo-server`:

```sh
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl restart xo-server.service
```

> For XO Proxy, the process is almost the same except the file to create is `/etc/systemd/system/xo-proxy.service.d/ca.conf` and the service to restart is `xo-proxy.service`.

### Let's Encrypt support

#### What's Let's Encrypt?

[Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/?ref=xen-orchestra.com) is a Certificate Authority developed by the Internet Security Research Group. It provides free TLS certificates and makes it easy for websites to enable HTTPS encryption and create a more secure Internet for everyone.

:::tip

Although Let's Encrypt is the most popular free public certificate authority (CA), XOA supports other CAs as well.

:::

#### What can it do for me?

Xen Orchestra Appliance (XOA) can **automatically request and renew HTTPS certificates from Let's Encrypt**. This lets you use a free, publicly trusted certificate instead of manually installing your own or relying on self-signed ones.

:::tip

Let's Encrypt will automatically renew your certificate **30 days** before expiration. And unlike "normal" certificates, no need to restart `xo-server` to enjoy your renewed certificate!

:::

#### Prerequisites

In order for XOA to work with Let's Encrypt, follow these prerequisites:

- Make sure your server is listening on HTTP on **port 80** and on **HTTPS 443**.

- In `xo-server`, to prevent HTTP access, enable the redirection to HTTPs:

```
[http]
redirectToHttps = true
```

- Your server must be reachable using the configured domain by the certificate provider (e.g., Let's Encrypt). This typically means it needs to be publicly accessible.
- Add the following entries to your HTTPS configuration:

```
# Must be set to true for this feature
autoCert = true

# These entries are required and indicates where the certificate and the
# private key will be saved.
cert = 'path/to/cert.pem'
key = 'path/to/key.pem'

# ACME (e.g. Let's Encrypt, ZeroSSL) CA directory
#
# Specifies the URL to the ACME CA's directory.
#
# A identifier `provider/directory` can be passed instead of a URL, see the
# list of supported directories here: https://www.npmjs.com/package/acme-client#directory-urls
#
# Note that the application cannot detect that this value has changed.
#
# In that case delete the certificate and the key files, and restart the
# application to generate new ones.
#
# Default is 'letsencrypt/production'
acmeCa = 'zerossl/production'

# Domain for which the certificate should be created.
#
# This entry is required.
acmeDomain = 'my.domain.net'

# Optional email address which will be used for the certificate creation.
#
# It will be notified of any issues.
acmeEmail = 'admin@my.domain.net'
```

#### How do I use Let's Encrypt?

To configure your XOA with Let's Encrypt:

1. In the HTTPS section of your XO configuration file, add the following entry:
    - `autoCert = true`
    - `acmeDomain = example.org`
2. Add an entry following this pattern: `acmeDomain = EXAMPLE`, where EXAMPLE is a [fully qualified domain name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fully_qualified_domain_name) (FQDN) that points to your XOA environment.
3. Load the FQDN in your browser.\
After a few seconds, the certificate will be automatically generated and installed

## Redis server

For advanced usage, you can customize the way XO connect to Redis:

```toml
# Connection to the Redis server.
[redis]
# Unix sockets can be used
#
# Default: undefined
#socket = '/var/run/redis/redis.sock'

# Syntax: redis://[db[:password]@]hostname[:port][/db-number]
#
# Default: redis://localhost:6379/0
#uri = 'redis://redis.company.lan/42'

# List of aliased commands.
#
# See http://redis.io/topics/security#disabling-of-specific-commands
#renameCommands:
#  del = '3dda29ad-3015-44f9-b13b-fa570de92489'
#  srem = '3fd758c9-5610-4e9d-a058-dbf4cb6d8bf0'
```

## Proxy for updates and patches

To check if your hosts are up-to-date, we need to access `https://updates.ops.xenserver.com/xenserver/updates.xml`.

And to download the patches, we need access to `https://fileservice.citrix.com/direct/v2/download/secured/support/article/*/downloads/*.zip`.

To do that behind a corporate proxy, just add the `httpProxy` variable to match your current proxy configuration.

You can add this at the end of your config file:

```toml
# HTTP proxy configuration used by xo-server to fetch resources on the Internet.
#
# See: https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-proxy-agent#maps-proxy-protocols-to-httpagent-implementations

httpProxy = 'http://username:password@proxyAddress:port'
```

## Reverse proxy

If you don't want to have Xen Orchestra exposed directly outside, or just integrating it with your existing infrastructure, you can use a Reverse Proxy.

First of all you need to allow Xen Orchestra to use `X-Forwarded-*` headers to determine the IP addresses of clients:

```toml
[http]
# Accepted values for this setting:
# - false (default): do not use the headers
# - true: always use the headers
# - a list of trusted addresses: the headers will be used only if the connection
#   is coming from one of these addresses
#
# More info about the accepted values: https://www.npmjs.com/package/proxy-addr?activeTab=readme#proxyaddrreq-trust
#
# > Note: X-Forwarded-* headers are easily spoofed and the detected IP addresses are unreliable.
useForwardedHeaders = ['127.0.0.1']
```

### Apache

As `xo-web` and `xo-server` communicate with _WebSockets_, you need to have the [`mod_proxy`](http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/mod_proxy.html), [`mod_proxy_http`](http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/mod_proxy_http.html), [`mod_proxy_wstunnel`](http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/mod_proxy_wstunnel.html) and [`mod_rewrite`](http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/mod_rewrite.html) modules enabled.

Please use this configuration in this order or it will not work. Do not forget the trailing slashes:

```apacheconf
RewriteEngine On
RewriteCond %{HTTP:upgrade} websocket [NC]
RewriteRule /[<path>]/(.*) ws://<xo-server ip>:<xo-server port>/$1 [L,P]

ProxyPass /[<path>]/ http://<xo-server ip>:<xo-server port>/
ProxyPassReverse /[<path>]/ http://<xo-server ip>:<xo-server port>/
```

### NGINX

Just configure your VirtualHost as usual (or your default site), with a `location` section like this one:

```nginx
location /[<path>] {
  # Add some headers
  proxy_set_header        Host $host;
  proxy_set_header        X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
  proxy_set_header        X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
  proxy_set_header        X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;

  # Proxy configuration
  proxy_pass http://<XOA ip address>[:<port>]/;

  proxy_http_version 1.1;
  proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
  proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;

  proxy_redirect default;

  # Issue https://github.com/vatesfr/xen-orchestra/issues/1471
  proxy_read_timeout 1800; # Error will be only every 30m

  # For the VM import feature, this size must be larger than the file we want to upload.
  # Without a proper value, nginx will have error "client intended to send too large body"
  client_max_body_size 4G;
}
```

That's all!
