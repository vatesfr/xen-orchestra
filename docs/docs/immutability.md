# Immutability

## What You’ll Find on This Page

This page covers the immutability feature: what it is, why it’s important, and how to set it up, including integration with Amazon S3.

## What Is Immutability?

In backup systems, immutability means that once a backup is created, it cannot be altered or deleted for a set period. This safeguards your backups against ransomware attacks, accidental deletion, or data corruption. 

Here’s how it works: You designate a storage repository that Xen Orchestra can write to, but cannot modify during the specified immutability period. Even if an attacker compromises XO, your backups remain untouched. The goal is to ensure that your backup data cannot be deleted, encrypted, or tampered with, unless someone with direct physical or root access to the storage intervenes.

Immutability can be implemented using external services like AWS S3 Object Lock, but Xen Orchestra also offers a native, on-premises solution that doesn’t rely on third-party infrastructure.

### Data Protection Modes

Immutability offers two distinct approaches in data protection, to meet different security and operational needs.

## Why It Matters

Immutability guarantees that your backups stay secure and verifiable over time. It acts as a critical defense against ransomware, human mistakes, or intentional tampering. Additionally, it helps organizations comply with legal requirements by ensuring that data remains unaltered for mandatory retention periods. In essence, immutability turns your backup storage into a write-once, read-many (WORM) archive, protecting your data when it matters most.

## Immutability Approaches
There are two primary models for achieving immutability:

### Object Storage

The first approach leverages **object storage solutions** like Amazon S3, where immutability is enforced using features such as [Object Lock](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/object-lock.html). In this setup, the storage provider itself manages the retention period. Once enabled, backups created by XO cannot be deleted or modified until the lock expires, providing an extra layer of security.

### On-prem Immmutability

The second model is an **on‑premises immutable repository**. It uses a lightweight package, installed on the backup repository. This program monitors and enforces immutability at the file-system level, ensuring that XO itself cannot delete or overwrite existing backups before the end of the retention period.

## Configuring on-Prem Immutability

To set up immutability on your local infrastructure, follow these steps:

### 1. Install the Required Package

1. Make sure **Node.js** is installed on your backup repository machine
2. Install the dedicated XO package globally:

```bash
npm install -g @xen-orchestra/immutable-backups
```

### 2. Configure the Immutability Settings

Create a configuration file at `/etc/xo-immutable-remote/config.toml`, with the following structure:

```toml
[remotes.remote1]
root = "/mnt/ssd/vhdblock/"
immutabilityDuration = "7d"
```

#### Mandatory Parameters

- **`root`**: Specifies the directory where Xen Orchestra stores backups.
- **`immutabilityDuration`**: Defines how long files remain protected from deletion (e.g., `7d` for 7 days).

#### Optional Parameters

For additional validation, you can enable:
```toml
rebuildIndexOnStart = true
```
This option scans and validates existing files when the service starts. It can be resource-intensive.

### 3. Start the Service
Launch the `xo-immutable-remote` service and check its logs (use `systemd`, for example) to confirm it is running correctly. For persistent operation, configure it as a system service.

## How It Works
Once active, any backups written by Xen Orchestra to this repository will be protected for the specified duration. Even if Xen Orchestra is compromised, the immutability configuration remains secure, as it is managed entirely on the backup host.

## Working With Immutable Backups

When setting up backup jobs in Xen Orchestra, select your configured immutable remote (whether it's an S3 bucket or an on-premises repository). Define your retention and rotation policies as you normally would. Immutability ensures that existing backups cannot be deleted or altered before their protection period expires, while still allowing new backups to be added.

## Best Practices

### Define a Clear Immutability Policy
Align the **lock duration** with your data retention strategy, compliance requirements, and disaster recovery goals. Make sure the policy reflects both legal obligations and operational needs.

### Secure Your Encryption Keys
Store encryption keys **separately** from your backup data. 

:::warning
Losing encryption keys will render backups **permanently unrecoverable**.
:::

### Maintain Independence from Xen Orchestra
The immutability enforcement mechanism **must** operate independently of Xen Orchestra. This ensures that even if an attacker compromises XO, they **cannot** delete or alter existing backups.

### Monitor Storage and Test Recovery
- Track storage capacity closely, as immutability prevents immediate deletion of older backups.
- Plan for additional space to accommodate protected backups over time.
- Test recovery procedures regularly, to make sure immutability does not disrupt your ability to restore data when needed.

## Limitations

Cloud-based solutions such as S3 Object Lock depend on your provider’s implementation; not all S3‑compatible systems behave identically, so always test before production use.

## Conclusion

Immutability adds a critical layer of protection to your backups in Xen Orchestra. Whether you use Amazon S3 or an on-premises repository, the core principle is simple: once a backup is created, you cannot change or delete it until the retention period expires.

By integrating immutability with strong encryption, proactive monitoring, and regular testing, you ensure that your backup data stays secure, reliable, and recoverable, even in the face of ransomware, human error, or malicious attacks. This approach transforms your backup strategy into a robust defense against data loss and corruption.
