- mixins can depend on each other, they will be instanciated on-demand

```js
import mixin from '@xen-orchestra/mixin'

class MyMixin {
  constructor(app, ...mixinParams) {}

  foo() {}
}

class App {
  constructor() {
    mixin(this, { MyMixin }, [...mixinParams])
  }
}

app = new App()
app.myMixin.foo()
```
