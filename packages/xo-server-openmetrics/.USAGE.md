Exposes XenServer/XCP-ng metrics in OpenMetrics/Prometheus format.

Like all other xo-server plugins, it can be configured directly via
the web interface, see [the plugin documentation](https://docs.xen-orchestra.com/advanced#openmetrics--prometheus-integration).

This plugin creates an HTTP server that exposes a `/metrics` endpoint compatible with Prometheus scraping. All metrics are enriched with human-readable labels (pool_name, host_name, vm_name, etc.) for easy filtering and visualization.

**Features:**

- Real-time metrics from all connected pools
- Host metrics: CPU, memory, network, disk IOPS/throughput/latency
- VM metrics: CPU, memory, network, disk, runstate
- Bearer token authentication
- OpenMetrics format with EOF marker
